    "## producer consumer problem in SYCL\n",
    "This code is a simple example of using SYCL (a C++ based heterogeneous programming framework) to implement a producer-consumer pattern for data processing on a GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The producer function generates some data (a vector of integers) and writes it to a buffer, while the consumer function reads the data from the same buffer, processes it (in this case, just printing it out), and releases the buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main function creates a SYCL queue object with a GPU selector, initializes the buffer, and launches the producer and consumer functions in sequence. The gpu_selector selects the first available GPU device for executing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses the buffer class to allocate memory on the device, and the handler class to define the scope of memory access operations. The accessor object is used to get read or write access to the buffer data. The submit method is used to submit the producer and consumer kernels to the device and to wait for them to complete using events. Finally, the wait method is used to synchronize the host and device execution.\n",
